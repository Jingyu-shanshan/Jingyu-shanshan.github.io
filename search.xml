This model ensures that class loaders delegate the task of class loading to their parent class loaders before attempting to load the class themselves.</p><p><img src="/en/2024/05/20/Parent-Delegation-Model/parent-delegation-model.png" alt="Parent Delegation Model Work Flow"></p><h2 id="Hierarchy-of-Class-Loaders"><a href="#Hierarchy-of-Class-Loaders" class="headerlink" title="Hierarchy of Class Loaders:"></a>Hierarchy of Class Loaders:</h2><ul><li>Java uses a hierarchical delegation model where every class loader has a parent class loader. The delegation starts from the top of the hierarchy with the bootstrap class loader, which is responsible for loading core Java classes (<code>java.*</code>).</li><li>Custom class loaders typically extend <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> and have a parent class loader, forming a chain up to the bootstrap class loader.</li></ul><h2 id="Delegation-Mechanism"><a href="#Delegation-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Delegation Mechanism:"></a>Delegation Mechanism:</h2><ul><li>When a class loader is asked to load a class, it first delegates this request to its parent class loader before attempting to load the class itself. This ensures that core Java classes and those provided by the application are loaded by the appropriate class loaders and prevents duplicate class definitions.</li><li>For example, if a custom class loader attempts to load a class named <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>, it will first delegate this request to its parent. Since <code>ArrayList</code> is part of the core Java libraries, it will be loaded by the bootstrap class loader.</li></ul><h2 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages:"></a>Advantages:</h2><ul><li><strong>Security</strong>: Prevents malicious classes from overriding core Java classes by ensuring they are always loaded by the bootstrap class loader.</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ensures that the same version of a class is used throughout the application, avoiding conflicts and inconsistencies.</li></ul><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>The parent delegation model ensures that the system class loader (or any custom class loader) delegates the loading of a class to its parent before attempting to load it itself. This hierarchical delegation helps in maintaining a clear separation of responsibilities and ensures that core Java classes are loaded by the trusted system class loader (or its parent)​.</p><h1 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h1><p>[1] <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/classloaders.html">Understanding Network Class Loaders</a></p>]]></content>

By following a hierarchical delegation model, it ensures the integrity and consistency of the class loading process, while also providing flexibility through custom class loaders.</p><h3 id="How-the-Class-Loader-Subsystem-Works"><a href="#How-the-Class-Loader-Subsystem-Works" class="headerlink" title="How the Class Loader Subsystem Works"></a>How the Class Loader Subsystem Works</h3><ul><li><strong>Loading</strong>:<ul><li>The Class Loader Subsystem loads class files into the JVM from various sources, such as local file systems, remote servers, or network locations.</li><li>This process involves locating the class file, reading its binary data, and then transforming it into a class object in memory.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Linking</strong>:<ul><li>Verification: Ensures the correctness of the bytecode, making sure it adheres to the JVM’s constraints and security standards.</li><li>Preparation: Allocates memory for class variables (static fields) and initializes them with default values.</li><li>Resolution: Converts symbolic references in the class file into actual references to memory locations.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Initialization</strong>:<ul><li>Executes the class’s static initializers and the static blocks of code.</li><li>This phase involves executing any class initialization code to set up static fields and other static structures.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Runtime-Data-Area"><a href="#Runtime-Data-Area" class="headerlink" title="Runtime Data Area"></a>Runtime Data Area</h2><p>Runtime data areas are essential components that support the execution of Java programs. The JVM runtime data areas include several key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Program Counter (PC) Register:</strong> Each JVM thread has its own PC register. At any point, each Java virtual machine thread is executing the code of a single method, the current method for that thread.</li><li><strong>Java Virtual Machine Stacks:</strong> Each Java virtual machine thread has a private Java virtual machine stack, created at the same time as the thread.<ul><li>Each method creates a stack frame when it executes, which stores the local variable table, operand stack, dynamic linking, method return address, and other information.</li><li>The process of calling a method and completing its execution corresponds to pushing and popping a stack frame in the JVM stack.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Native Method Stacks:</strong><ul><li>These stacks are similar to JVM stacks but are used for native methods. </li><li>The HotSpot JVM does not distinguish between the JVM stack and the native method stack, treating them as a single stack​</li></ul></li><li><strong>Method Area:</strong> This area stores class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors. In the HotSpot JVM, this area is often referred to as the “Permanent Generation” (PermGen), though in JDK 8 and later, it has been replaced by the “Metaspace”</li><li><strong>Heap:</strong> The heap is shared among all JVM threads and is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. The heap is created at JVM startup and is managed by the garbage collector, which reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable​.<ul><li>From a memory reclamation perspective, it is divided into the young generation and old generation, which are further subdivided into Eden space, From Survivor space, and To Survivor space.</li><li>From a memory allocation perspective, it may include multiple thread-local allocation buffers (TLABs) for private allocation by threads.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h1><p>[1] <a href="https://medium.com/java-for-beginners/understanding-java-virtual-machine-jvm-architecture-e68d1c611026">Understanding Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Architecture</a><br>[2] <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se6/html/Overview.doc.html">The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine</a></p>]]></content>
